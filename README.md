### Hi, I'm Abhay ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I love to learn! Whether it be low-level concepts relating to operating systems or more application oriented fields such as mobile and web development, I am always looking for the next interesting topic to explore in computer science.

### My Current Work

-   [**CodeLab**](https://www.codelabdavis.com), a UC Davis Club, where I am the VP of Infrastructure. I develop and maintain cloud infrastructure solutions for all of the organizations projects. I also mentor teams' quarterly projects with clients.
-   [**Hey Toad**](https://github.com/athacker2/Hey-Toad), a speech controlled personal assistant I am currently developing in Python. I am using this project as a chance to explore applying NLP models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) in a practical application and also hope to load the program onto a Raspberry Pi in the future

### My Past Work

-   [**Visa Inc.**](https://usa.visa.com), where I interned on the Payment Products Development team, working on developing command-line tools in C++ and Assembler.
-   [**Gunrock Breakspace**](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/index.html), an on-campus research group led by Professor Zubair Shafiq focused on cyber-security. I worked on developing methods to identifying browser-fingerprinting intent using ML models.
-   [**Hands Together**](https://www.handstogether-sa.org), a non-profit that provides early education to preschoolers. I worked on a software development team to build a full stack website for them using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
